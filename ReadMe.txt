Hello there! Thank you for looking at my project!



RULES AND CONTROLS:

Controls:

The player can move forward by pressing the "w" key and rotate clockwise or counter-clockwise using the "a" or "d" keys respectively, rotating the player is not a continuous process and the key must be pressed multiple times in order to continue turning.

Rules:

The goal of the game is to collect the most apples without running into the walls within the alloted time.

Time allotments are based on score as follows:

Points 1-5: ~ 10 seconds
Points 5-10: ~ 7 seconds
Points 10+ : ~ 5 seconds

To play the game:

Open the folder titled "Apple Grabber" as a project in your favorite python interpreting software. This was developed in JetBrains PyCharm, it is recommended that you run the game from this software as well. 

Personal Note from Adam:
This project is one of my first creative projects made using python, I plan to polish the mechanics and supporting material such as a start screen and an option to restart the game without restarting the entire program. 

If you have any comments or recomendations please visit the contact page on my website at: https://www.adamleugers.com/contact

At the time of writing this my high score on the game is 32. If you beat my score I'd love to hear about it!
